	<h2>During MCO period, we are not allowed to go out & need to stay at home for our own sake.</h2>
	<h2>We should use time effectively and do the good activities with members or family.</h2>
	<h2>So I changed my schedule to the simple one but enjoyable. It's completely different from my daily routine at University.</h2>
	<h2>The main point I need to make sure as a student is being disciplined wherever I am.</h2>

	<font size="+2" color="1B4F72">
	<p>My third activity is reading novels.</p>
	<p> I like to reading novel because reading novel can release my boring at home</p>
	<p>Either than reading novel through printed novel that we buy from bookstore,</p> 
	<p>we also can read novel through online with our smartphone, tablet or any device.</p>
	<p>Some title of novel I reads during MCO period:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Maaf Jika Aku Tak Sempurna</li>
		<li>Gelak Tergolek</li>
		<li>Actually, I Love You</li>
	</ul>

	<font size="+2" color="1B4F72">
	<p>There a lot of musical instrument we can learn but I prefer recorder as it is unique.</p>
	<p>Since my sister has an advantages playing recorder so I decided to learn with her.</p>
	<p>For me it's quiet hard yet entertaining.</p>
	<p>I have learned some song such as:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Happy Birthday</li>
		<li>Twinkle Twinkle Little Star</li>
		<li>Marry Had Little Land</li>
	</ol>
	<p>I used to learn songs at:</p>

	<h2>5. Playing Indoor Games</h2>
<img src="images/indoorgames.jpg" height="400" width="400">
	<font size="+2" color="1B4F72">
	<p>In order to cure our boredom at home, my family and I choose to play indoor games together.</p>
	<p>Instead of playing online games, we need to play the games with our family to tighten the family bond.</p>
	<p>In my suggestion, some games that we can play together are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Chess</li>
		<li>Scrabble</li>
		<li>UNO Card</li>
		<li>Carrom</li>
		<li>Hide and Seek</li>
		<li>Puzzle</li>
	</ul>
	<p>We also do a trending challenge which is "Whisper Challenge". The positive impacts by playing this are we can create happiness, reduce stress and decrease the risk of high blood preasure</p>
